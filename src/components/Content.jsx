            <Text fontWeight="bold">Background</Text>
            BETT Token offers a revolutionary opportunity and way to think of
            the sports betting industry. The sports betting industry has seen
            tremendous growth, outdoing most industries and becoming the fastest
            growing industry even in unexpected markets, yet it hasn't taken
            advantage of the opportunities blockchain technology offers.The
            industry faces challenges such as fragmentation of platforms, and
            unattractive risk-reward ratios. Bett Token addresses these issues
            by providing a unified solution for bettors.

            <Text fontWeight="bold">Vision</Text>
            Our vision is to create a decentralized, efficient, and
            user-friendly ecosystem for sports betting transactions, enhancing
            the betting experience while offering significant advantages over
            traditional fiat currency transactions. At the same time giving
            bettors autonomy of value,where they're no longer just bettors and
            punters but stakeholders in the sportsbetting ecosystem, and their
            transactions provide liquidity to a currency that is 100% owned by
            the community. BETT token is going to be a bettor and community
            first token, with a growth roadmap planned around the ecosystem and
            the bettors.
